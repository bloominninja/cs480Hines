========================================

Building This Example
---------------------


To build this example cd to P5 directory, then

>$ cd build
>$ make

*If you are using a Mac you will need to edit the makefile in the build directory*

The excutable will be put in bin


Additional Notes For OSX Users
------------------------------

Ensure that the latest version of the Developer Tools is installed.



Running This Example
---------------------
Place the desired model (with one mesh) into the models folder

Navigate to the bin and run the matrix executable along with the "obj" file to load. 
Example "./Matrix dragon.obj". If obj is not found the loader will load the default 
dragon mesh 

Right click in the window to access the menu and change rotation speed

Left click to change the rotation of the model

Press a to reverse the orbit

Press escape or use the right click menu to quit


Known Bugs/fixes
---------------------
Some obj files fail to compile the fragment shader (sphere.obj), placing the obj in bin and modifying line 38 
to read "" allows obj files to load properly
